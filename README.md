Introduction:
The importance of Artificial Intelligence is not hidden to anyone these days. Itâ€™s fascinating the way Artificial Intelligence has become involved in our lives and we encounter it in our daily lives without even realizing it. From aiding in avoiding traffic, offering movies or music recommendations, voice-controlled personal digital assistants, the famous self-driving cars and vehicles, instant translation of machines, and many other predictive capabilities are just some applications of the forms Artificial Intelligence has taken up today. AI makes our lives more efficient every day. AI empowers many programs and services that help us do everyday things such as connecting with friends, using an email program, or using a ride-share service.
In this project, we have used the power of AI for making life easier for those patients who have difficulty in reading their medicine labels or prescriptions due to small fonts. Our team has developed a mobile app that uses the camera of a smartphone to scan the text of a medical prescription bottle or some other product items and reads out the text. This application is a good example of how AI technology is useful in our everyday lives.
